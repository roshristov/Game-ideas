# Game concept for the university project on C++:

## Concept 1: Dungeons and Dragons, but the computer is the dm. 
The graphics will be ASCII graphics with a map and landmarks. You can choose what to do in situations.

## Concept 2: Darkest Dungeon type of game. 
Fairly similar, with a few changes so that it can work in C++ command line.

I will be going with concept 1; I know what I need to do to make it work.

Main things: the ‘story’ will be pre-written and used by the computer; the ‘map’ will be randomly generated with different graphics for different landmarks, like towns, ruins, caves, dungeons, etc. The players (up to 3 players) will have an option to pick where they want to go. 

There likely won’t be too much roleplay like in the real deal. It would be difficult to implement how the computer will react to what the players mean by what they are saying. It would just be a standard game with the foundations of D&D.

The sets of the players will be presets that they can pick from, like wizard, paladin, fighter and the other D&D classes. There may be the option to let them pick what items they want, but for now, there will only be presets. At any time, they can write in a code (like for player 1, “player one equipment”) that will show them what they have, what their stats are, what their moves are and what they do, and how much health, mana and armor they have.

They need to write in at what level their stats will be (Charisma, Strength, Wisdom, the rest). These stats will decide how well they do at certain tasks.

When the players pick the place they want to go (like a cave or a town), the computer will pick what the players will experience from a pre-determined set of situations and encounters. At the end of the situations (either at the end of a maze, after finishing a major encounter or after completing a puzzle), they will get a reward. It will either be a good amount of EXP or good items, like a good sword, protective armor or other useful stuff. After they are done, they will be put on the map and they will have the choice to go somewhere else.

Dungeons will have a map that the players will uncover the more they move through it. It will always be shown on the screen where they have been and where they haven't been to yet. The map will be randomly generated to make it unique every time the players enter a dungeon.

A during the encounters, the players will fight against different monsters and humans. They will know at what order they will rotate and do their actions (I think it was the speed stat, not completely sure). The players won’t know at how much health the hostiles are or what actions they might make. At the end of the encounter, the players might get some EXP or items to be used.

There will be a day/night system. Most actions the players take will increment the clock by a certain amount. At night time, the situations and encounters will be different. They will mostly be more difficult (like not seeing well in the dark, stronger monsters, etc.), but there might be some cases where it might be easier at night time (like evading guards and other sneaky tactics). The players will be able to sleep to restore their health and mana and move the clock forward, but they can only do that at night and at safe places (like an inn).

The towns will have shops and other beneficial places for the players. At the towns, there might be mission boards where they can pick what they can do for a known reward, or they might encounter an NPC that either points them in a direction to go or gives them something for what the players did (like if the players helps them out of a situation).

The story will be a preset that the computer will pick from, it won’t be randomized (that would be difficult to make right). The story will progress after most encounters the players do. If they succeed and survive the encounters to the end, they will reach the ending of the game. The computer will say what happened to the players’ characters at the end (there likely won’t be many variations, might be too cumbersome to implement).

(If you want, you can suggest ideas in this document for the game.)
